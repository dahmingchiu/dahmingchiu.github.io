				<p>&#8220;Happy birthday! How's your retirement? You brought me into academic research and let me see how excited it is! I still remember I stayed overnight to work out something that accidentially turns into my IWQoS paper. What a great memory.&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8220;I am glad to have Prof. Chiu as my supervisor during my PhD study at CUHK. Prof. Chiu is a kind and cute gentleman. He is always open to different opinions and glad to discuss interesting research problems and give suggestions to me. Besides, he is also willing to join us to experience life in young people's styles. I still remember the time we attended a conference in Italy. We traveled around the country to see beautiful buildings and taste delicious food. It was amazing that he could even speak Italian and acted as an interpreter for us. That was one of my most pleasant memories. Wish Prof. Chiu good health and happiness in the future!&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8220;Happy Birthday Professor Chiu!  Your influence over me on how to identify problems in an analytical way cannot be overstated and I am always grateful for that. Thinking back, my M.Phil days was challenging, but that was the times where I grew immensely, empowered me to shimmer over this world of many bright, intelligent minds. Please enjoy your well deserved retirement and have peace.&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8220;Happy birthday! I always remember the days with you in CUHK, which made a lifelong influence on my career and life. From you, I learned two important things: be curious about the world, and be supportive of students. Thank you.&#8221;</p>
